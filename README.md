A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing Tempo worklogs in JIRA. This server supports both Jira Server/Data Center and Jira Cloud with Tempo Cloud, enabling AI assistants to retrieve, create, update, delete, and bulk-manage time entries.

## 🖼️ Visual UI with MCP Apps

TempoFiller now supports **MCP Apps** - rendering rich visual interfaces directly in compatible AI chat clients like Claude Desktop. Instead of just text responses, you get interactive calendar and timesheet views!

### Timesheet Grid View

Ask for your logged hours and see them in a familiar Tempo-style pivot table:

![Worklogs Timesheet Grid](docs/demo_get_worklogs.png)

**Features:**
- Issues as rows, time periods as columns
- Coverage-aware coloring (green = full, yellow = under, red = gap)
- Zoom toggle: Days / Weeks / Months
- Total row with logged/required hours comparison

### Schedule Calendar View

Check your work schedule with a visual calendar:

![Schedule Calendar](docs/demo_get_schedule.png)

**Features:**
- Month grid with working days (green) and non-working days (gray)
- Shows required hours per day
- Holiday and weekend awareness
- Summary with total working days and required hours

> **Note:** Visual UIs render in MCP Apps-compatible hosts (Claude Desktop, VS Code). CLI hosts receive the same structured data, which the AI formats conversationally.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install in VS Code

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_tempo--filler-0098FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=ffffff)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22tempo-filler%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22%40tranzact%2Ftempo-filler-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22TEMPO_BASE_URL%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atempo_base_url%7D%22%2C%22TEMPO_PAT%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Atempo_pat%7D%22%7D%7D)

The install button configures the Server/Data Center mode. Jira Cloud users should use the manual Cloud configuration below.

### Install in Claude Desktop

[![Download Desktop Extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Desktop_Extension-0098FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=claude&logoColor=ffffff)](https://github.com/TRANZACT/tempo-filler-mcp-server/releases/download/v2.0.2/bundle.dxt)

1. Click the button above to download the desktop extension (`.dxt` file)
2. Open Claude Desktop and go to **Settings** → **Extensions**
3. Drag the downloaded `.dxt` file into the extensions panel to install
   - *If dragging doesn't work:* Click **Advanced Settings** → **Install Extension** and select the downloaded file
4. Fill in the **Tempo Base URL** and **PAT** in the environment variables section
5. Don't forget to **enable it**!

The desktop extension currently prompts for Server/Data Center credentials. Jira Cloud users should use the manual Cloud configuration below.

### Install from this repository locally

Use this when testing this fork or unpublished local changes. The VS Code button, Claude Desktop extension link, and `npx` examples use the published upstream package; a local MCP install should point directly at the built server file.

1. **Clone and build this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lbr88/tempo-filler-mcp-server.git
   cd tempo-filler-mcp-server
   npm install
   npm run build
   pwd
   ```

2. **Use the absolute path from `pwd` in your MCP config**.

   Jira Server/Data Center:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tempo-filler-local": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/tempo-filler-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TEMPO_BASE_URL": "https://jira.company.com",
           "TEMPO_PAT": "your-jira-personal-access-token"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Jira Cloud + Tempo Cloud:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tempo-filler-local": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/tempo-filler-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "JIRA_BASE_URL": "https://your-site.atlassian.net",
           "JIRA_EMAIL": "you@example.com",
           "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-atlassian-api-token",
           "TEMPO_TOKEN": "your-tempo-api-token"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

For Claude Desktop, add the server object under `mcpServers` in `claude_desktop_config.json`. For VS Code, add the same server object to your MCP configuration.

### Install Manually on your favorite AI Assistant

#### Jira Server/Data Center

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tempo-filler": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@tranzact/tempo-filler-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "TEMPO_BASE_URL": "https://jira.company.com",
        "TEMPO_PAT": "your-jira-personal-access-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Jira Cloud + Tempo Cloud

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tempo-filler": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@tranzact/tempo-filler-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_BASE_URL": "https://your-site.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_EMAIL": "you@example.com",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-atlassian-api-token",
        "TEMPO_TOKEN": "your-tempo-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cloud mode is selected automatically when `JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, and `TEMPO_TOKEN` are all present. Tempo Cloud API requests default to `https://api.tempo.io`; set `TEMPO_BASE_URL` only if you need to override that endpoint.

## 💬 Real Usage Example

Here's an actual conversation showing how natural and powerful the interaction can be:

---

**👤 User:**
> fill my october hours with the same project from september

**🤖 AI Assistant:**
> I'll help you fill your October hours with the same project from September. Let me first check your September worklogs to understand the pattern, then fill October accordingly.

```json
🔧 mcp_tempo-filler-_get_worklogs({
  "startDate": "2025-09-01",
  "endDate": "2025-09-30"
})
```

> Perfect! I can see you worked on **PROJ-1234** (Tempo MCP Server) for 200 hours in September. Now let me get your October work schedule to see which days need to be filled.

```json
🔧 mcp_tempo-filler-_get_schedule({
  "startDate": "2025-10-01",
  "endDate": "2025-10-31"
})
```

> Excellent! I now have all the information needed. Let me fill all 23 working days in October with the Tempo MCP Server project using 8 hours per working day.

```json
🔧 mcp_tempo-filler-_bulk_post_worklogs({
  "billable": true,
  "worklogs": [
    {"issueKey": "PROJ-1234", "hours": 8, "date": "2025-10-01", "description": "Tempo MCP Server development"},
    {"issueKey": "PROJ-1234", "hours": 8, "date": "2025-10-02", "description": "Tempo MCP Server development"},
    // ... 21 more entries for all working days
  ]
})
```

> ✅ **October Hours Filled Successfully**
>
> - **Project**: PROJ-1234 (Tempo MCP Server)
> - **Total Hours**: 184 hours across 23 working days
> - **Hours per Day**: 8 hours (matching your standard work schedule)
> - **Status**: All entries created successfully with no failures
>
> **Tool Calls Made:**
> - `get_worklogs` - Retrieved September pattern (PROJ-1234, 200h)
> - `get_schedule` - Found 23 working days in October (184h capacity)
> - `bulk_post_worklogs` - Created 23 entries in one operation
>
> Your October timesheet is now complete and matches the same project pattern you used in September!

---

**🎯 What Happened Here:**
- **3 Tool Calls**: `get_worklogs` → `get_schedule` → `bulk_post_worklogs`
- **Smart Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identified PROJ-1234 from September data
- **Schedule Awareness**: Only filled working days, skipped weekends automatically
- **Bulk Operations**: Created 23 worklog entries in a single API call
- **Error-Free Execution**: 100% success rate with proper validation
- **Natural Language**: No need to remember issue keys, dates, or tool syntax

**⏱️ Time Saved**: This single natural language request triggered 3 MCP tool calls and replaced hours of manual timesheet entry!

- **Create Worklogs**: Add single worklog entries with automatic issue resolution
- **Bulk Operations**: Create multiple worklog entries efficiently using concurrent processing
- **Delete Worklogs**: Remove existing worklog entries
- **Get Schedule**: Retrieve work schedule with working/non-working day information
- **Visual UIs**: Rich calendar and timesheet grid views via MCP Apps
- **Resource Access**: Browse worklog data and recent issues
- **Prompt Templates**: Generate analysis prompts for worklog data

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- A **JIRA instance** with **Tempo Timesheets** installed, or **Jira Cloud** with **Tempo Cloud**
- Credentials for your deployment mode:
  - Server/Data Center: a JIRA Personal Access Token
  - Cloud: a Jira API token plus a Tempo API token

### NPX (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the server is with npx - no installation required:

```bash
npx @tranzact/tempo-filler-mcp-server
```

Just configure your AI assistant to use `npx @tranzact/tempo-filler-mcp-server` as the command.

### Development Setup (Source)

For development or customization:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lbr88/tempo-filler-mcp-server.git
   cd tempo-filler-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and build**:

   ```bash
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The server supports two authentication modes. Use one complete set of variables.

### Jira Server/Data Center

Use this mode when Tempo is installed on the same Jira Server/Data Center instance.

**Required:**

- `TEMPO_BASE_URL`: Your Jira instance URL (for example, `https://jira.company.com`)
- `TEMPO_PAT`: Jira Personal Access Token used as a Bearer token

### Jira Cloud + Tempo Cloud

Use this mode when your Jira site is hosted at `*.atlassian.net` and Tempo uses the Tempo Cloud API.

**Required:**

- `JIRA_BASE_URL`: Your Jira Cloud site URL (for example, `https://your-site.atlassian.net`)
- `JIRA_EMAIL`: Email address for the Atlassian account
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: Atlassian API token for Jira REST API access
- `TEMPO_TOKEN`: Tempo API token for Tempo Cloud API access

**Optional:**

- `TEMPO_BASE_URL`: Tempo API base URL. Defaults to `https://api.tempo.io`.

Alternative Atlassian-style names are also accepted: `ATLASSIAN_URL`, `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`, and `ATLASSIAN_API_KEY`. `TEMPO_PAT` can be used instead of `TEMPO_TOKEN`, but `TEMPO_TOKEN` is clearer for Cloud setups.

### Shared Optional Environment Variables

- `TEMPO_DEFAULT_HOURS`: Default hours per workday (default: 8)

### Creating Credentials

#### Server/Data Center PAT

Create this token in your Jira Server/Data Center profile. Jira Personal Access Tokens are available in Jira 8.14+.

1. Log into your Jira Server/Data Center instance.
2. Open your user profile menu.
3. Go to **Profile** → **Personal Access Tokens**.
4. Select **Create token**.
5. Give it a clear name, such as `Tempo MCP Server`.
6. Set an expiry date that matches your security policy.
7. Create the token and copy it immediately.
8. Use the copied value as `TEMPO_PAT`.

The token must belong to a user who can view issues, view worklogs, create worklogs, update worklogs, delete worklogs, and view schedule information in Tempo.

#### Cloud Tokens

Cloud mode needs two different tokens: one Atlassian token for Jira issue/user lookups, and one Tempo token for Tempo worklog and schedule APIs.

**Create the Jira Cloud API token:**

1. Go to [Atlassian API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
2. Select **Create API token** or **Create API token with scopes**.
3. Name it clearly, such as `Tempo MCP Server - Jira`.
4. Set an expiry date.
5. If you use scoped tokens, grant Jira read access for issues and users. The server uses Jira to resolve issue keys and the current user; Tempo worklog writes use the Tempo token.
6. Create the token and copy it immediately. Atlassian only shows the token once.
7. Use the token as `JIRA_API_TOKEN`.
8. Use the same Atlassian account email as `JIRA_EMAIL`.

**Create the Tempo Cloud API token:**

1. Open your Jira Cloud site.
2. Open Tempo, then go to **Settings**.
3. Under **Data Access**, select **API Integration**.
4. Select **New Token**.
5. Name it clearly, such as `Tempo MCP Server`.
6. Set an expiry date.
7. Grant the access needed by the tools you plan to use:
   - Worklogs: manage access for `get_worklogs`, `post_worklog`, `bulk_post_worklogs`, `update_worklog`, and `delete_worklog`.
   - Schemes / User Schedule: view access for `get_schedule`.
8. Confirm and copy the token immediately. Tempo only shows the token when it is created.
9. Use the token as `TEMPO_TOKEN`.
